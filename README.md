Please NOTE: This was my very first solo analysis and looking back now I realized I was rushing and didn't take enough time
to thoroughly skim the data to see what the best business questions/hypothesis/recommendations could be drawn from them

I had not completed the Google Analytics program yet, therefore because the courses have a monthly charge I wanted to complete
everything while I was on the final stretch. I realize now it could have been better and am working on a new analysis right now 
with a different data set that will be much more thorough! Either way, thanks for reading and checking it out, the new analysis 
will be posted in the next couple of days.
