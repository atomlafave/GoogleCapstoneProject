Please NOTE: This was my very first solo analysis and looking back now that I am working on my second analysis and all
of my courses are complete, I realize I was rushing through this one and didn't take enough time to skim everything in 
order to draw the best business questions/recommendations from the data.

I had not completed the Google Analytics program yet, therefore because the courses have a monthly charge I wanted to complete
everything while I was on the final stretch. I realize now it could have been better and am working on a new analysis right now 
with a different data set that will be much more thorough! Both in the questions that I will draw from the data and the visualizations
used to interpret it. Either way, thanks for reading and checking it out, the new analysis will be posted in the next couple of days.
